1. Making a thread that repaints our gameBoard around every 0.04 seconds.
	1.1. Making a moveTo method that changes the location of fruits.

2. implement (1) coins,  (2) score, (3) life, (*4) It would be so nice if we implement the rocket and hammer. 

3. Saving the user data. (Last level, Score, Coins, number of rockets, ...)
	3.1. make a reset option that resets the user data, OR we can be smarter and have multiUser option.

4. implement all 10 levels. (We have 4)
	4.1. should we make more complex levels like the original game? If we have time.

5. make hint option. It shouldn't be hard.
