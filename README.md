# Pet-Rescue

## Todo list

- Define the differents levels and stock them on a hard disk
- Introduce constraints and options as things progress
- How to remove a case
- Define the obstacles fixed
- How to represente the board

## Some advices in this implementation

- Split the model and the view
- Split the differents works in objects and methods
- Game environment : where we choose the level, the player's progression. We can also make a demonstration and present him the rules.
- Board : Case[][], be careful to play in the cases 
- Add a bot who could play instead of a human ?
